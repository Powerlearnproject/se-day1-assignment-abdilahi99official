#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering refers to the structured application of engineering principles in software development process.
.It facilitate the process of building software products hence pushing forward the tech industry.
.It ensures that software products are effective and solve the intended real world problems.
.It also ensures that software products are less prone to bugs hence minimizing major tech disasters.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1.Development of programming languages such as C.
2.Establishment of software engineering as a discipline.
3.Establishment of structured programming.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1.Planning-it involves defining the scope and purpose of the software as well as the problem it is solving.
2.Requirements gathering and analysis-it involves establishing features for the software as required by the targeted audience. This can be achieved through interviews and questionnaires and analysing responses received.
3.Software design- it involves creating software architecture and structure in aspects such as navigation, user interface data flow and data storage.
4.Software implementation- it involves converting the software design to an actual program through coding.
5.Sotware testing- It inovlves creating test cases reflecting the required features and then putting the coded software under examination.
6.Software deployment-It involves releasing a well tested software to the actual market for feedback and reviews. Besides user manuals and training sessions on how to operate the software are conducted in this phases.
7.Software maintenance- it involves providing technical support to users and releasing software updates for new features or for fixing bugs.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology involves a continuous step by step approach in software development where each phase is completed before going to the next. An appropriate scenario would be developing a mobile app for an existing system such as learning mangement system.
On the other hand, agile involves short cycles of development testing, deployment and feedback until the whole product is comprehensive and able to meet much of the requirements. An appropriate scenario would be developing a web app for a new emerging sector such application of AI in voice generation.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1.Software developer- responsible for implementing the software through coding, debugging and previewing.
2.Project manager- in charge of overseeing software development team in carrying out their planned activities and ensuring that project milestones are reached under the allocated resources.
3.Quality Assurance Engineer - responsible for ensuring the software is effective and meets the standards set.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs facilitate coding through features such as debugging , text editors and live previews hence enhancing software developers' productivity. Example is Visual Studio Code.
VCS facilitate collaboration among software developers through version controlling and tracking hence enhancing team work. Example is Git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1.Evolving requirements of softwares lead to stalled and unaccomplished projects due to expensive costs. To overcome this teams need to adopt agile approach in their development process to accomodate changing requirements.
2.Limited time leads to poor and ineffective softwares. Software engineers need to adopt agile approach in their process to mitgate risks due to limited time.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1.Unit testing- involves testing individual components of the software to ensure that each component is effective.
2.Integration testing- involves testing the communication links between different components of the software to ensure an effective flow of information in the software.
3.System testing- involves testing the software as a whole to ensure it produces the correct output and results.
4.Acceptance testing- involves users testing the software to check on its acceptance and viability.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering refers to the process of crafting queries that are used to elicit responses from artificial intelligence models such as chatbots and LLMs.

These queries are significant because they enable humans to interact with AI models by instructing them or extracting information from them.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Prompt 1: "Create a simple program to add two numbers"
Prompt 2(updated): "Create a simple program in python that requests inputs of two numbers, add them and print the sum"

The updated prompt is more effective because it provide specific details unlike the previous prompt.
